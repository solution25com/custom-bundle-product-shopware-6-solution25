## Best Practices

- **Use meaningful names for your bundles**: This helps customers understand what they're getting.  
- **Test bundle combinations thoroughly**: Check how discounts and quantities affect the storefront display.  
- **Maintain layout consistency**: Ensure the bundle layout is uniform across similar product types.  
- **Leverage Shopware’s translation features**: Provide localized bundle names and descriptions for international stores.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: Buy box missing in the layout**  
✅ Solution: Ensure the **Buy box** block is added to your layout in the CMS.

**Problem: Discounts not reflected in storefront**  
✅ Solution: Check that the bundle discount is set correctly in the **Bundle** tab and the layout is assigned to the product.

✅ Solution:
